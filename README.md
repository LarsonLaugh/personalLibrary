# Personal Library Management by Git
Git is a powerful tool for tracking any changes in your repository and can also be useful for managing an online personal library, like checking newly added books and your reading traces, and more functions to be expected in the near future. 

### How to use
```
git clone https://github.com/LarsonLaugh/personalLib
```
- Store all your books (catergoried into individual folders, notice the tree of library doesn't support subfolders) in `Library` folder
- Open `config.sh` file to edit your `TARGET_DIR`.
- Linux user just type `./libtrack.sh` to produce daily report and syncronize your library via git from your server or client terminals.
